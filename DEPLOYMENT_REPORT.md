# Directory Microservice - Deployment Report

## Project Overview
Successfully created a comprehensive directory microservice application following the minimal backend mode with rollback mechanisms. The application implements a company directory & HR training orchestrator with React frontend and Node.js backend.

## Architecture Implemented
- **Onion Architecture**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation layers
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js with rollback mechanisms
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema with mock data fallback
- **State Management**: Zustand for frontend state
- **API Integration**: Mock-first approach with graceful degradation

## Key Features Delivered

### 🏢 Organization & Company Management
- Company registration and verification system
- HR contact management
- Company status tracking (pending, verified, rejected)
- Domain verification workflow

### 👤 Employee Profile Creation & Enrichment
- Employee profile management
- External API integration mocks (LinkedIn, GitHub, Credly, ORCID, YouTube, Crossref, Gemini)
- Skills normalization and value proposition generation
- Profile enrichment with relevance scoring

### 🧑‍🏫 HR Training Requests
- Personalized, group, and instructor-specific training requests
- Training approval workflow
- Instructor management system
- Training scheduling and completion tracking

### 👩‍💼 HR Role & Permissions
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- HR dashboard with analytics
- Employee management interface
- Training request approval system

### 🧱 Integrations Layer (Mock-First)
- Complete mock adapters for all external services
- Rollback utility for graceful API failure handling
- Mock data fallback system
- External service integration framework

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Server**: Running on port 3001
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:3001/health` ✅
- **API Routes**: All major endpoints implemented with rollback
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive sample data for testing
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, input validation
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns

### Frontend (React + Tailwind)
- **Build**: Successfully created dist folder ✅
- **Pages**: All major UI flows implemented
- **Components**: Reusable components with proper props
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for data management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes

### Mock Data & Rollback System
- **Sample Data**: Comprehensive JSON with companies, employees, training requests, instructors
- **Rollback Utility**: Automatic fallback to mock data on API failures
- **External Services**: Mock adapters for LinkedIn, GitHub, Credly, ORCID, YouTube, Crossref, Gemini, SendPulse, SendGrid, Skills Engine, Marketplace, Assessment, Content Studio, HR Reporting, DevLab, Learning Analytics
